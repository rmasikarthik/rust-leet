///Given an issue title and an array of current labels, return an updated array of labels based on the following rules:

///If the issue doesn't have any labels, add:

///"bug" and "needs triage" if the title contains "error" or "bug"
///"enhancement" and "discussing" if the title contains "feature" or "add"
///Otherwise, if the given labels contain:

///"needs triage" and the title contains "simple" or "easy", remove "needs triage" and add "good first issue"
///"discussing" and the title contains "planned" or "next", remove "discussing" and add "on the roadmap"
///Otherwise, if "needs triage" or "discussing" is present, remove it and add "help wanted"
///If the title contains:

///"security", add a "critical" label
///Tests:
///1. triage_issue("app crashes with error", []) should return ["bug", "needs triage"].
///2. triage_issue("app crashes with error", ["bug", "needs triage"]) should return ["bug", "help wanted"].
///3. triage_issue("add dark mode", []) should return ["enhancement", "discussing"].
///4. triage_issue("add dark mode", ["enhancement", "discussing"]) should return ["enhancement", "help wanted"].
///5. triage_issue("xss security bug", []) should return ["bug", "needs triage", "critical"].
///6. triage_issue("security vulnerability in auth", []) should return ["critical"].
