///Given a number of milliseconds since the last post on an issue, and the last message posted on the issue, determine what you should do with the issue according to these rules:

///If the last message is less than 7 days ago, return "leave it"
///If the last message is 7 or more days ago and its content contains "bump" (case-insensitive), return "close it"
///Otherwise, return "bump it"
///Tests:
///1. triage_issue(86400000, "Lets fix it") should return "leave it".
///2. triage_issue(1209600000, "still waiting") should return "bump it".
///3. triage_issue(864000000, "bump") should return "close it".
///4. triage_issue(604800000, "Do we still want this?") should return "bump it".
///5. triage_issue(604800000, "Bumping this") should return "close it".
///6. triage_issue(345600000, "I'll make a PR") should return "leave it".
